In my formalization I would like to have some discussions about the 

`variety <-> coordinate ring`

duality and how this is reflected by the 'definable sets' intuition. Similar for other theories like vector spaces.

Also, the normal form in an atomless boolean algebra seems interesting, since it is all finite and thus already works with a pretopos/coherent category.


* Equivalence between classifying topos of algebraically closed fields and real closed fields

* category of finitely presentable vector spaces as a regular syntactic category. Gau√ü normal form as computational procedure on the equivalent category of matrices.

* Tarskian axiomatic geometry and affine spaces? (that probably makes no sense)
