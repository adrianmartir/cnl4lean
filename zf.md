Things I may need to think about in order to get my changes to `zf` merged:

Idea: Have `Abstract.hs` abstract over the backend.

* `stack` vs `nix`. I guess one prominent issue with nix may be deploying to windows.

Future features:

* Lambdas
* Using LaTeX labels `\label{myTheorem}` as identifiers
* Structs
* Inductive types
